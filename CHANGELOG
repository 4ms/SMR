## How to determine firmware version
To view the firmware version, tap the ROTATE button 10 times rapidly to enter “Custom Scales” mode.

Starting with Firmware version 2, the Blue/Green/Red elements of the Env. Outs LEDs read as a binary code of the firmware version number, with Channel 1 Red being the least significant bit, and Channel 6 Blue being the most significant bit. 

Like this:

`(Ch6 Ch5 Ch4 Ch3 Ch2 Ch1)` 

`(BGR BGR BGR BGR BGR BGR)`

**Firmware version 1:** All Env Out LEDs normal colors (no binary code)
`(??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???)`
**Firmware version 2:** Channel 1 Green
`(000 000 000 000 000 010)`
*Future firmware versions will follow the same format:***Firmware version 3:** Channel 1 Yellow (green+red)
`(000 000 000 000 000 011)`
